  After monitoring the encrypted communication at EvilCorp, for a while,
  you finally have the information needed to crack their entire encryption scheme.
  And judging by the message you first choose to decrypt
  it would seem the inclinations of the IT guy will be on full display.
  Find the key N to decrypt the flag.

flags:
  # multiple flags can be provided
  # A static case sensitive flag
  - UiTHack25{B1gB34ut1fulNumb3r5}

# Topics are used to help tell what techniques/information a challenge involves
# They are generally only visible to admins
# Accepts strings
topics:
  - Elliptic Curves
  - Discrete Logarithm Problem
  - Pohlig-Hellman Algorithm

# Tags are used to provide additional public tagging to a challenge
# Accepts strings

  # set difficulty
  - hard

  # hint at the type of challenge or language used
  # should not give away too much, only guide the player when choosing a challenge

  - Python

# Optional settings #
# remove if unused

# Provide paths to files from the same directory that this file is in
# Accepts strings

  - src/handout.txt
  - src/decrypt.py

# Requirements are used to make a challenge require another challenge to be
# solved before being available.
# Can be removed if unused
# Accepts challenge names as strings or challenge IDs as integers
requirements:
  - "Defining Curves"

# If the field is omitted, the challenge is visible by default.
# If provided, the field can take one of two values: hidden, visible.

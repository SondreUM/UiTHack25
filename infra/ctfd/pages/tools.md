# Tools
here are some tools that might be of use to solve various challenges

### [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra)
Useful program for reverse engineering. It is comletely free.

### [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
Program used for packet sniffing and packet inspection.

### [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)
Math focused programming framework built on Python. Especially good at number theory.
We recommend 3 possible approaches to downloading it:
* Using Conda on Linux/WSL2
* Using Homebrew on Mac
* Deploy in docker container

building from source has proven to be overly time consuming and unreliable.

### [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
Very useful library in Python for a lot of pwn challenges in CTFs.

### [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
Useful to launch alternate types of operating systems should that be needed.
If you are comfortable without using a GUI then maybe [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is enough.

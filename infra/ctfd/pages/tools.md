# Tools

<br>

Here are some tools that might be of use to solve various challenges, more will be added soon...

Additionally we would higly recommend checking out CTF resources like **[CTF101](https://ctf101.org/intro/what-is-a-ctf/)** to get an introduction to different topics you might encounter.

### [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra)

A powerful reverse engineering tool developed by the NSA, Ghidra enables deep binary analysis by decompiling executables, supporting multiple architectures, and providing advanced code visualization capabilities.

### [pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) and [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef)

Advanced GDB debugging plugins that transform the debugging experience with enhanced visual interfaces, real-time register tracking, and simplified exploit development workflows.

### [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2024-12-1?requestededition=community) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

Web application security and API testing platforms for intercepting, analyzing, and manipulating HTTP/HTTPS requests during web-based CTF challenges.

### [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)

Comprehensive Python library specifically designed for binary exploitation, providing utilities for remote process interaction, shellcode generation, and rapid exploit development.

### [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

Network protocol analyzer for detailed packet inspection, supporting hundreds of protocols and critical for network forensics and traffic analysis challenges.

### [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Virtualization solutions for creating isolated testing environments, with VirtualBox offering full virtual machines and Docker providing lightweight, reproducible container deployments.

### [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)

Mathematical software system ideal for cryptography and number theory challenges, built on Python with advanced computational capabilities.
We recommend 3 possible approaches to downloading it:

* Using Conda on Linux/WSL2
* Using Homebrew on Mac
* Deploy in docker container

Building from source has proven to be overly time consuming and unreliable.

### [IDA Free](https://www.hex-rays.com/ida-pro/)

Professional-grade disassembler and debugger used extensively in reverse engineering, offering advanced static and dynamic analysis tools.

### [Radare2](https://rada.re/n/)

Open-source reverse engineering framework supporting multiple architectures, providing powerful binary analysis and debugging capabilities.

### [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

Web-based encryption, encoding, and data transformation tool perfect for cryptography and steganography challenges.

### [Volatility](https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/)

Memory forensics framework for analyzing system memory dumps, critical for forensic and memory-based CTF challenges.

### [NMAP](https://nmap.org/)

Network discovery and security auditing tool for port scanning, service detection, and network reconnaissance.

### [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/)

Password cracking tool designed to test password strength and break cryptographic hashes across various algorithms.

### [Binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk)

Firmware analysis tool for extracting and analyzing embedded file systems, particularly useful in reverse engineering challenges.

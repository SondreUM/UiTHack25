# UiTHack25{Rules}

## Preface

This CTF is a passion project by student members of TD, the informatics student organization at UiT. We want everyone to be able to partake in the joy of CTFs, no matter if you are a beginner or veteran. As such we try to host this CTF every year. To ensure that this CTF is a joy to everyone, this year too, we first have to lay down some ground rules.

## Rules

1. No brute force or DDoS unless excplicitly stated otherwise. We would like to keep the servers up so the fun can continue.
2. Don't pwn the infrastrcture. Accidents can happen, but please notify us with a ticket so we can fix it.
3. Interference with other teams is not allowed. This means both virtually and irl.
4. Cheating will not be tolerated. Disqualification will be done at our own discretion.
5. Only onsite UiT students are eligible for prizes. Others cannot claim the prize for you, you have to be there yourself.

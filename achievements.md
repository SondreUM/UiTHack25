# UiTHack25{Achievements}

Achievements are special challenges that can be completed by players that distinguish themselves in some way during the event, a Hall of Fame if you will. They are designed to encourage players to try new things and to reward them for doing so. Some achievements can be earned during the event, while others can only be earned after the event has ended.

Achievements can be anything from solving a certain number of challenges to finding a hidden easter egg. Some achievements are hidden and can only be discovered by players who are willing to go the extra mile.

The table below lists all the achievements that are available to earn during the event. Hidden achievements will have their description hidden (replaced with `???`) until they are claimed.

## Rules

- Some achievements may require players to submit proof of completion (stated in the description), these can be claimed by submitting a ticket with proof.
- Unclaimed achievements will not be rewarded.
- Unless otherwise stated, achievements can only be earned by individual players, not teams.
- Only one player can earn each achievement, first come first served.
- All players may earn achievements, regardless of whether they are playing on-site or remotely (unless otherwise stated). However, rewards may only be claimed by players who are present at the award ceremony.
- Any achievements that are earned during the event will be announced in the discord server. After the event, all achievements will be announced on in the announcements channel and at the award ceremony.

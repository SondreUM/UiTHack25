# Noob - Noob4

> Noob - easy

Shit! The constant back and forth with the flag has corrupted it. I'm trying to read it, but it just doesn't work!

You can connect to the server with the following command `ssh noob4@uithack-2.td.org.uit.no -p 6003`

The password is the flag from the previous noob challenge.

Use command `exit` to disconnect from the server when you are done.

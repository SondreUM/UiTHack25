> Misc - medium

EvilCorp controls it all â€” your personal data, your freedom, and even your future. You have found a way to leak some data from their security systems, just enough to help you crack their security code. You have 7 attempts and 1 minute to break their code. Fail, and the system will activate a kill switch, instantly notifying EvilCorp's security division.

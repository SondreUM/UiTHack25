    Our AI has been acting up lately. Apparently, it has been inserting wierd symbols and leaking secrets all over the codebase.
    And of course, our unpaid interns are unable to find them, kids these days *sigh*.
    Can you help us find all the secrets? You might have to clean them up a bit before you can extract them.
    PS: pls dont tell the boss, he loves that AI and will blame us for everything.

# Knock Knock

> Misc - easy/medium

In the rain-slick alleys of San Sequestro lies an underground safehouse where the city's most wanted netrunners hide. No retinal scans, no fingerprints - just an old-school precise knock sequence on a rusted steel door grants access to those who prove themselves worthy. Can you crack the sequence and access the secrets within?

Note: this challenge uses the HTTP protocol and can be done in a browser.

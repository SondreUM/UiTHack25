## Writeup

The name is a slight hint that the code is stuck in a limbo.
The filename is intended to provide the remaining information to decipher that it is LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR).

LLVM IR can be compiled using standard LLVM tools to executables. In general this requires running the same machine (Ubuntu x86_64) that is stated in the file, though
it is likely to complete with only warnings on most Linux distros. It even works with warnings on macOS running on arm64.

Opening the yields LLVM IR code where a flag is visible, however it is not the correct flag, but rather the recognizable input to printf.

Reading about the filetype and LLVM IR it should be possible to arrive at the conclusion tha the tools llc and clang are both able to compile this code to an executable.

Running this command for example:
```
clang -o program program.ll
```
will compile the LLVM IR to an executable for the machine, which can the be executed to get at the actual flag.

Alternatively one could step thru the assembly-like syntax of the LLVM IR to find the solutions, but that would be very time-consuming.

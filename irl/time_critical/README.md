Oh no! The intruder alarm has been triggered in the middle of your heist!
You need to disable it before the police arrives.

Unfortunately, the alarm system is so old that it relies on obscurity, there is no way to reverse engineer it in time.
You need to get the administrator code from his tablet, and type it into the alarm system in the basement.
But be quick, the code changes every 30 seconds!

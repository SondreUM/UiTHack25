  We have acquired access to the screen of a user "Bobby" with the necessary privileges to view the codes to the factory.
  Unfourtunately he seems to have left for the weekend and we need to access it before he returns.
  We've managed to send him messages, but he's not there to read them.
  The connection isn't all that great, but we're sure you can make do.

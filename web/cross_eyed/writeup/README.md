## Challenge

The challenge is based on cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
The flag is available in plaintext on "Bobby"s computer which the participant is given a supposedly live feed of.
The user can also send messages to Bobby that will display on his computer, this is the intended avenue for XSS.

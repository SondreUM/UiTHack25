# Web - !big_picture 🔍

> Web - easy

 My "guy" told me that he had a really important message for me that he had to hide.
    He told me that he would leave it in plain sight, but I can't seem to find it!
    The only clue he gave me was that he would use a "big picture" to hide it.
    Can you help me out?
